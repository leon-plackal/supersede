# Supersede
Supersede was born out of a desire to transform aimless scrolling into an opportunity for learning, growth, and discovery. 
We believe that your precious time spent online can be more than just a momentary diversion; it can be a journey of enlightenment.

This application allows users to specify their interests in various topics and sources, such as news articles, reddit, youtube and even AI generated content!
They can then receive relevant posts each day from these sources. Supersede holds focus as key to ones productivity throughout the day,
therefore the app has no comments, likes or profiles to lure you away into the trap of social media. You are limited to 50 posts a day
and they will be reset every 24 hours unless saved.

Features coming soon: Users may choose to mark certain posts as interesting or irrelevant, thus fine-tuning their future results the more they use the app!

This project has been deployed: [Supersede](https://supersede.pages.dev/).
